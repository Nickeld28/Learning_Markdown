## ABOUT

I created this project to learn step-by-step **Markdown**,   
a lightweight markup language for formatting text.

## [MARKDOWN SYNTAX](/Markdown_syntax.md/)

As I learn Markdown syntax, I will write down the basic usage rules in separate files.  

All rules will be combined into one [file](/Markdown_syntax.md/) as instructions.
