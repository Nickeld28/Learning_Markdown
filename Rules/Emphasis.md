## EMPHASIS RULES

To change the style of the text, you need to highlight it on both sides with special characters.

The type of text will depend on what special characters are used and how many there are.

### There are three basic types of emphasises:
 
1. Italic text is highlighted with "*" or "_"
2. Bold text is highlighted with "**" or "__"
3. Strikethrough text is highlighted with "~~" \

### Ð¡ombinations of different emphasises are acceptable

* Bold Italic text is highlighted with "***" or "___"

* It is usually recommended to use "*" instead of "_"

* Strikethrough may not work in some Markdown dialects.
