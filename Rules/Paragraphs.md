## PARAGRAPHS RULES

To divide text into paragraphs, you need to add a blank line between them.

### Three methods for breaking a line within a paragraph:
 
1. Putting two or more spaces at the end of the line - "  "
2. Putting a backslash at the end of the line - "\\"
3. Using the break HTML tag - \<br>

## EXAMPLES:

>First paragraph
>
>Second paragraph. \
Next line of second paragraph
>
>Third paragraph.   
Next line of third paragraph
>
>Fourth paragraph. </br>
Next line of fourth paragraph
