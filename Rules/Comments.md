## COMMENTS RULES

There are several working ways to write a comment, but not all of them work correctly.

### Recommended cross-platform way to create a comment:
 
    (empty line)
    [comment]: # (Here is a comment for example)


### An alternate way is to use HTML comment tag:
    <!-- comment using HTML tag -->

## EXAMPLES:

[comment]: # (Here is a comment for example)

<!-- comment using HTML tag -->

Examples are invisible because them are comments.
